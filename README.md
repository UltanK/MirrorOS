MirrorOS is a new platform for smart mirrors that focuses mainly in interactivity featuring voice commands and a smarthpone remote app. It runs web apps which are easy to build and has a set of APIs that developers can use to easily integrate voice commands and smartphone remote control.

**NOTE**: This project is in a very early phase. You can expect bugs and crashes. It has been tested on Raspberry Pi 2 and 3.
## Installation
Install pyaudio

```sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio```

Clone repo

```git clone https://github.com/s6joui/MirrorOS```

Run 

```cd MirrorOS```
```npm install```

and then
```npm start``` to start the program.

Follow the configuration steps below to get everything working.

## Configuration
Most apps will need access to API keys from different services to fully work. Edit the ```config.json``` file and add your own API keys.
In this file you can also set the default home app and the default assistant app as well as enabling gesture support but this requires you to have the appropiate sensors to work.
## Minimunm hardware requirements
- Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
- USB microphone

## Remote control
You can control MirrorOS from any device that has a browser by going to the IP address that's shown on the top left of the screen. It's specially useful with a smartphone.
From the remote control app you can install other apps, launch apps and use your smartphone's microphone to send commands to the mirror.

Simply zip your files so that the manifest.json stays at the root of the zip and upload to a server. You can then install the app by entering the url on the remote control app.
